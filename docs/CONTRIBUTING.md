# Contributing

Thank you for improving the Recurram Zig implementation.

## Scope

This package implements the Recurram wire format and session-aware encoder/decoder. Keep changes aligned with the normative spec in [recurram/recurram](https://github.com/recurram/recurram).

## Development

Requirements:

- Zig 0.15.2 (minimum 0.15.0)

```bash
zig fmt build.zig build.zig.zon src tests
zig build test
```

Interop scripts under `scripts/` can be run when changing cross-language fixtures.

## Commit Messages
